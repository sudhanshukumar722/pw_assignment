  Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand. A comma operator is used as a separator for 
  multiple expressions at a place that requires a single expression. When a comma operator is placed in an expression, it executes each expression and returns the rightmost 
  expression.

 Syntax:-
          Expression1, Expression2, Expression3, ...so on.

 Example :- 
             for (let a = 0, b =5; a <= 5; a++, b--) { 
                console.log(a, b); 
             }


    O/P---- 0 5
            1 4
            2 3
            3 2
            4 1
            5 0
