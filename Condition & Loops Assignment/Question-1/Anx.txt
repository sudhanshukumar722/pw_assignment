A conditional statement tells a program to execute an action depending on whether a condition is true or false. It is often represented as an if-then or if-then-else statement.if the computer determines conditions to be true, it executes a specific command.

Syntax:- 
         if (condition) {
            //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
            

      }

Example:- 
          let houe=10;
          if (hour < 18) {
          greeting = "Good day";
           }
   O/P----Good day


 Syantx:-
           if (condition) {
                     //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
                 } else {
                     //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
              }

  Example:-
            Let hous=20;
             if (hour < 18) {
                 greeting = "Good day";
              } else {
              greeting = "Good evening";
            }
